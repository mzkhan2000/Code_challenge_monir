### How to run the program to get all the outputs and tests the program? ###

* Please unpack zip file and open folder **'Code_challenge_monir-master'** as a project in any python IDE such as Pycharm.
* Please setup the python environment such as virtual environments and import pyhton libraries from requirement.txt file
* Run the python file **auto_traffic_counter.py** to get all the outputs:
    * Task 01: the number of cars seen in total
    * Task 02: a sequence of lines where each line contains a date (in yyyy-mm-dd format) and the number of cars seen on that day (eg. 2016-11-23 289) for all days listed in the input file.
    * Task 03: the top 3 half hours with most cars, in the same format as the input file
    * Task 04: the 1.5 hour period with least cars  

### The program generates following output: ###

* Task 01: the number of cars seen in total
